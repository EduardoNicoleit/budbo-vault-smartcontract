# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 62](src/Vault.sol#L62)

	```solidity
	        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
	```

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 76](src/Vault.sol#L76)

	```solidity
	            buboToken.transfer(owner, _amount),
	```

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 112](src/Vault.sol#L112)

	```solidity
	            buboToken.transfer(_recipient, amountOfTokens),
	```



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 3](src/Vault.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
	```



## L-3: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 3](src/Vault.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Constants should be defined and used instead of literals



- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 40](src/Vault.sol#L40)

	```solidity
	            0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306 // ADD MAINNET ADDRESS FOR DEPLOYMENT
	```

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 102](src/Vault.sol#L102)

	```solidity
	            (10**ethPriceFeedDecimals)) / tokenPriceInUSD;
	```



## NC-2: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event TokensPurchased(
	```

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 32](src/Vault.sol#L32)

	```solidity
	    event TokensTransferred(address recipient, uint256 amountOfTokens);
	```

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 34](src/Vault.sol#L34)

	```solidity
	    event BuboTokensReceived(address indexed sender, uint256 amount);
	```
